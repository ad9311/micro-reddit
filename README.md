Follow these steps in order to simulate a post with comments.

- Create a new user:
  - ```
    User.create(username: 'myusername', email: 'myemail@mymail.come', password: 'mypassword')
    ```
- Create a new post associated with an user:
  - ```
    Post.create(title: 'myposttitle', body: 'body_should_be_30_chars_long', user_id: 1)
    ```
- Create a new user using the first steps
- Create a new comment associated with the second user
  - ```
    Comment.create(commenter: 'anyuser', body: 'body_should_be_500_chars_max', user_id: 2, post_id: 1)
    ```
To delete any row of any model element run this command. For example let's delete a user with id of 3:

User.delete(3)
```

If you want to delete the datatable completely run the following command:

```
rails db:drop
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
